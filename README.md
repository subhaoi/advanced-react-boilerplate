# React Starter

A personal starter kit with all the essentials to kick off any project with minimal rewrite.

## Features

- Structured everything! Somewhat opinionated.
- Storybook integration setup included.
- Testing from the start.
- ENVs built into webpack and react for different builds
- Minimal amount of libraries in `dependencies` to get you started.
- Not so minimal in `devDependencies`. ðŸ˜„

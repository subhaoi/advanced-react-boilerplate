# Utilities

Code is bundles into common usecases like javascript types and exported for use throughout the app. These bundles (e.g. `arrayUtil`) don't impact business logic on a large scale, but can be used throughout the app in order to DRY or enhance the functionality of services or components in need of a separate toolkit to accomplish their purpose.

## Examples

1. Arrays
2. Dates
3. Media <sup>1</sup>
4. Objects
5. Strings
6. Validation <sup>2</sup>

<small>[1] - An example that may be a utility here is a resize image function.</small>
<small>[2] - May be advantageous to have functions that handle generalized form validation throughout the app.</small>
